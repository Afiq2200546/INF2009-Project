    "data": "Hello Den! Your body temperature is slightly lower than usual at 31.71\u00b0C (89\u00b0F). Given your age, this could be due to environmental factors or mild dehydration. However, a heart rate of 117 bpm while the ambient temperature is 30.6\u00b0C suggests you might need to cool down and take deep breaths. It's advisable for you to stay in a cooler environment if possible."
